# Video Analysis and Chat Application

This application allows you to upload videos, analyze them using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, and chat with the video content. The application extracts detailed information from videos including:

- Timestamp-based breakdown of the video
- Objects, people, and activities visible at each timestamp
- Text visible in the video
- Transcript of spoken content
- Overall summary of the video

All this information is stored in a vector database (ChromaDB) to enable semantic search and natural language querying of the video content.

## Key Features & Improvements (2025)

- **Robust Metadata Handling**: Video analysis data is stored in ChromaDB with strict type safety (no None/null values in metadata), ensuring reliable storage and retrieval.
- **Semantic Search & Retrieval**: Uses Sentence-Transformers for high-quality embeddings and ChromaDB for fast, context-rich search.
- **Debug Logging**: Extensive debug logs for chunk storage and query results help troubleshoot and validate retrieval accuracy.
- **Hierarchical & Enriched Indexing**: Video is analyzed and indexed at fine granularity (timestamps/scenes), with rich context for each chunk.
- **Multi-stage Retrieval**: Queries are semantically matched, reranked, and assembled for comprehensive answers.

## Features

- Video upload and processing
- Detailed video analysis using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Vector database storage for efficient retrieval
- Interactive chat interface to ask questions about the video
- Beautiful and responsive UI

## Video Upload & Analysis Limitations

- **Maximum video file size:** 100MB (enforced by backend)
- **Recommended video length:** 1â€“5 minutes (due to Gemini API/model constraints)
- **Longer videos:** Gemini API may only analyze the first few minutes. For advanced users, split longer videos into segments and upload/analyze each separately for full coverage.
- **Supported formats:** MP4, MOV, AVI, and other common video formats
- **Analysis quality:** Higher quality videos yield better results

## API Key Requirements

This application requires a Google API key with access to the Gemini 2.0 Flash model:

1. Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to get your API key
2. Enable the Gemini API in your Google Cloud Console
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file as shown in the setup instructions
4. **IMPORTANT**: Never commit your API key to version control. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` for this reason.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/akashmishra97/Chat_With_Videos_Using_AI.git
   cd Chat_With_Videos_Using_AI
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Usage

1. Upload a video file (MP4 format recommended)
2. Wait for the analysis to complete (this may take a few minutes depending on the video length)
3. Review the detailed analysis with timestamps
4. Use the chat interface to ask questions about the video content
5. **If your video is long and analysis stops early, split it into smaller parts and upload each part separately.**

## Technologies Used

- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for video analysis
- Flask for the web server
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings
- JavaScript for the frontend

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in environment variables and not hardcoded in the application
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing API keys

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **No results for queries?** Check the terminal for `[DEBUG]` logs. Make sure chunks are stored and queries return relevant results.
- **Analysis stops after a few minutes?** This is a Gemini API/model limitation. Split longer videos and analyze in parts.
- **Want to extend or customize?** See `app.py` for advanced configuration (e.g., chunking, retrieval strategies, logging).
